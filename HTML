<h1>How Political Stance and Verification Shape What Goes Viral on X</h1>
<h2> <i>“Republicans would rather shut down the government than help millions of Americans afford health care”. </i> </h2>

<p>When <a href="https://x.com/BarackObama/status/1972330745449284044"> Barack Obama shared this tweet </a> on X, it went viral across the platform. That single tweet, focusing on one of the greatest political issues of the year, racked up to almost 25,000 retweets. It wasn’t just the former president who shared his thoughts regarding the issue, content exploded across X from other politicians, media outlets, making it more difficult for smaller accounts to gain traction. This viral wave resulting from digital PR is neither random or uncommon: political polarization drives virality.

<h3> Political Stance: The Strategy </h3>
<p> In the world of digital interaction, simply adopting a clear stance is a winning strategy. Opinionated or emotional content tends to perform better on social media, with political information and news spreading rapidly across digital channels. Controversy, humor, and shock generate revenue and grab attention, whereas neutrality is overlooked and ignored. The emotion that tends to spread the fastest is outrage, which include feelings like anger, contempt, and disgust following moral judgements. According to research, each <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s44271-024-00062-z"> moral-emotional phrase </a> included in a political tweet increases the chance of that tweet being retweeted by 20%. The psychological consequences are immediate: users experience rises in political polarization and outrage within just 30 minutes of using X! This means that posts against something tend to spread the fastest. Politicians use X along with other social media platforms to establish their narrative and ideally influence others. We know if you take a side, specifically a clear one with outrage, you are going to get attention. Whether that attention is good or bad attention, there really is no such thing as bad virality. This trend is fueled by <a href=“https://www.nature.com/articles/s44271-024-00062-z”> platform algorithms </a> which prioritize posts that align with the users’ views. This naturally pushes divisive and opinionated posts to spread the fastest.
</p>
<h3>Verification: The Reach</h3>
<p>
Going viral is a combination of status and strategy. The status provides the reach and spreads your content to diverse audiences, whereas strategy provides the engagement, which drives the number of comments, likes, shares, retweets etc. As shown in the chart, verified accounts consistently maintain a slight lead regarding retweet counts.

<p>
However, the definition of this “status” has evolved over the years. The blue checkmark, once a symbol reserved for authentic public figures, brands, and journalists, has been reduced to a feature that can be purchased by anyone who subscribes to <a href=“https://nealschaffer.com/how-to-get-verified-on-twitter/”> X’s premium subscription </a> for $8 - $11 per month. The <a href=“https://nealschaffer.com/how-to-get-verified-on-twitter/”> eligibility criteria </a> for the blue check is pretty minimal: a profile photo, a name, active account, confirmed phone number etc. Subscribers also receive premium services, which include more characters within their tweets, videos, and priority in their posts, which are pushed to the top of the feed. This confirms that the status of having the subscription provides the necessary reach for users to spread content to diverse audiences. This shift has created some chaos and confusion. It's hard to know whether verification signals credibility or privilege these days. For many government and corporate entities, there has also been the introduction of <a href=“https://nealschaffer.com/how-to-get-verified-on-twitter/”>Gold and Gray checkmarks </a>, to distinguish them from the general paid accounts, which may help with this issue. With the recent shift on how to obtain verification on social media platforms, many wonder how this will affect the spread of misinformation and how does this change our trust in social media?
</p>
<h3>Credible or Misinformation</h3>
<p>
The primary issue of this pay to play model is that verification no longer guarantees trustworthiness. There have been fake accounts that cheat the systems and pay for the checkmark to spread scams or propaganda, with a fake account under the name <a href=“https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/the-confusion-and-risks-surrounding-twitters-verified-account-changes”>”National Weather Service” </a>, impacting reliability during emergencies. As anchor Amna Nawaz pointed out on <a href=“https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/the-confusion-and-risks-surrounding-twitters-verified-account-changes”>PBS News Hour </a>, Elon Musk stripped the New York Times of their verified status. He also suspended accounts of journalists who follow him. According to <a href=“https://nealschaffer.com/how-to-get-verified-on-twitter/”>Neal Schaffer </a>, it is important for journalists and news outlets to get verified on Twitter, because people have a tendency to pretend that they are someone else online to spread misinformation or to discredit others. However, since 2022, users are left questioning the legitimacy of every verified account, whether they are simply a paying subscriber or have credibility in what they write?
</p>
<h3>The New Reality of Digital Virality</h3>
<p> The current dynamics on X reveal that virality is created by combining readily accessible status with emotional content. The <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/american-political-science-review/article/who-leads-who-follows-measuring-issue-attention-and-agenda-setting-by-legislators-and-the-mass-public-using-social-media-data/D855849CE288A241529E9EC2E4FBD3A8"> American Political Science Review </a> states it perfectly: The ultimate result is a feedback loop that reinforced political polarization. These two points, paid verification and hyperpartisan stance, do not operate independently. They build a powerful system lacking trust, where status is bought and outrage is amplified, leaving users questioning the legitimacy of the information they consume.
